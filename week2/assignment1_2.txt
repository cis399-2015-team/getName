 Question 2:
 FINDING PUBLIC IP IN EC2 CONSOLE
 In the list of instances, each instance in the table has a
 column for Public IP, which lists the Public IP for each. \n
 One can also query to find the public IP in the terminal. 
 Public IP = Broadcast (Bcast) IP 
 Command(s) - ifconfig | grep inet
          inet addr:10.0.1.226  Bcast:10.0.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0

FINAL PROJECT PROPOSAL:
For our final project, we would like to create a php interface to act as a 
stripped down version of the EC2 AWS console.  The php interface will use the
AWS EC2 CLI SDK for PHP and be able to send commands to our different instances
through a web interface.

GOALS:
Our goal for this project is to create a simple web interface to our instances
that allow us to do simple tasks to specific instances.

EFFECT ON USERS:
The users will be limited to authorized system administrators for our ec2
instances.  Therefore the users will be limited to the professor and getName
group members.  Therefore the focus for users will be more on security, which
is discussed in the next section.

SECURITY ISSUES:
One of the main issues we will need to focus on security.  Since we will be
making a web interface that requires a login, security of login will be our
main focus to prevent anyone from being able to poke at our instances.

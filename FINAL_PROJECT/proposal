FINAL PROJECT PROPOSAL:
For our final project, we would like to create a php interface to act as a 
stripped down version of the EC2 AWS console.  The php interface will use the
AWS EC2 CLI SDK for PHP and be able to send commands to our different instances
through a web interface.

GOALS:
Our goal for this project is to create a simple web interface to our instances
that allow us to do simple tasks to specific instances. We would like to be
able to securely log on to the interface, perform simple tasks on each of the
instances, and prevent any unauthorized use of the interface.

EFFECT ON USERS:
The users will be limited to authorized system administrators for our ec2
instances.  Therefore the users will be limited to the professor and getName
group members, and will be limited to the amount of features that we can get
implemented with the remaining time we have left in the term..  

Therefore the focus for users will be more on security, which is discussed in 
the next section.

SECURITY ISSUES:
One of the main issues we will need to focus on security.  Since we will be
making a web interface that requires a login, security of login will be our
main focus to prevent anyone from being able to poke at our instances.  Our
focus will be to only allow authorized users, prevent any unauthorized use, and
to encrypt and keep secure any and all traffic/transactions.  We want a simple
interface that will be unavailable to unauthorized users.

MAINTENANCE & AUTOMATION:
After we begin to establish an interface and functionality, we would like to be
able to automate the setup using the puppet code.  In this manner we will be
able to add more instances and automate the setup process for each by running
puppet agent -t.

DOCUMENTATION:
We will also provide a man page and documentation on our interface for other
future system admins that may take over the maintenance and development 
(in theory).  Also it will allow for easier grading due to the documentation of
the interface functionality and features (plus the aspects of security).

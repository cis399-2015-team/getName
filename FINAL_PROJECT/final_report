This project touches more on adams experience, he is handling a good portion of the php services. I have taken a web class a few years back, but this was in regards to more of the interface rather then database and other delegation services such as php. I guess you can say Adam is taking lead on the model and controller, but Friday consist of walk through of any new changes that group members are unaware of. As noted the design represents a mvc (model view controller) design pattern. Our group meets every Friday from 1-4 typically in the same room class is taught. We use the projection monitor so everyone can view one screen. Typically in our Friday discussion/code sesh we go over features/complications and how we will implement them. We also communicate through social services online for remote communication.  

We first discussed the design features needed for our interface, such as should we have a shell included, stop, start and restart features and even a double check authentication process such as reference checking ip addresses and credential login checks through sql database. The ip checks we later found out is probably not a viable solution since they can change through different subnets. The first steps were setting up Ssl on each of our instances, looking back we should have done this through puppet master.

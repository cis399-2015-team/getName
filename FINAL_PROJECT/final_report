This project touches more on adams experience, he is handling a good portion of the php services. I have taken a web class a few years back, but this related to interface more rather then database and other delegation services such as php. I guess you can say Adam is taking lead on the  part of model and doing the majority of the controller, but Friday consist of walk through of any new changes that group members are unaware of. As noted the design represents a mvc (model view controller) design pattern. Our group meets every Friday from 1-4 typically in the same room class is taught. We use the projection monitor so everyone can view one screen. Typically in our Friday discussion/code sesh we go over features/complications and how we will implement them. We generally have someone live coding why others research implementations as well as clear up any confusion any one has through the process. The first part of the assignment consisted of chaz and cody searching for html examples and instructions for setting up interface. 

Regarding design features, originally we wanted to include a shell built into web page, but found time was an issue, because of everyones busy schedule. Adam brought up the stop, start and restart features. We all thought that was a good starting point. We even discussed a double check authentication/security process such as reference checking ip addresses and credential login checks through sql database. The ip security protocol we were thinking of implementing ended up not being a viable solution since they can change through different subnets.We also discussed using php encrypting service for m5 but found it had a reputable history of breaches, we ended up using SSL, which was rather straight forward. We each set up our own certificate on our instances. Puppet master would of been ideal choice, but delegating work and seeing it for ourselves was also on the list.
